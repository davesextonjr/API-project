Welcome to No Room At the Inn.

This project is a clone of airbnb for the purposes of demonstrating developing skills.

You can find the site here: http://noroomattheinn.herokuapp.com/


Some of the technologies on show case:
    The backend is built using sequelize.
    It takes advantage of some of the built in validators and security features of this middleware.

    The frontend uses react to dynamically serve content. It manages state by using redux. The project demonstrates using reacts contexts as well.

    The css is an exploration of different ways to layout items on a page. It takes advantage of some of the dynamic qualities of flex-box and grid.

    It also takes advantage of the clean look of modals.

    There are several features currently under development (user page, image functionality, google maps api).
